<p>Hello! My name is Samantha Hamilton and this is my code review. Per my ePortfolio proposal in Module 1, I am reviewing a project from one of last terms’ classes- a RESTful API for CS-340 Client/Server Development. 
This RESTful API is split into three files- one called “FinalProject_CRUD”, one called “FinalProject_Retrieval”, and a third called “FinalProject_REST”. The purpose of these three Python files are to, respectively, perform basic CRUD operations, basic data retrieval, and process RESTful queries by use of URIs. I stand by my decision to split these up into three documents, for organization’s sake. I believe doing so keeps the RESTful API logically organized.</p>

<p><b>Comment and Coding Conventions</b></p>
<p>Two out of three files are lacking in comments. The third, “FinalProject_REST”, has proper commenting at the start of each of the declared URIs. All three follow many coding conventions, such as proper indentation (which is necessary for Python), logical flow, and proper naming conventions. My variable names are descriptive and relevant. They say, without having to add an additional comment, exactly what that variable’s purpose is, such as “myQuery” or “newCollection”.</p>

<p><b>Error Handling</b></p>
<p>This RESTful API uses HTTP errors. When running a file, a localhost server is created and each call of each function results in the output of an HTTP error such as 400, 404, or 200.</p>

<p><b>Performance</b></p>
<p>This RESTful API is easy on performance. It is not a demanding application. The code is structured in such a way that performance is optimized as much as possible.</p>

<p><b>Functionality</b></p>
<p>The files “FinalProject_CRUD” and “FinalProject_Retrieval” function completely as intended, with documentation that includes screenshots and explanation to go along with it. The file “FinalProject_REST” has the same documentation and the localhost server runs, but the functions do not execute as intended.</p>

<p><b>DEVELOPER CHECKLIST</b></p>
<p>My code compiles	YES</p>
<p>My code has been developer-tested and includes unit tests	YES	</p>
<p>My code is tidy (indentation, line length, no commented-out code, no spelling mistakes, etc)	YES</p>
<p>I have considered proper use of exceptions	YES</p>
<p>I have eliminated unused imports	YES</p>
<p>I have eliminated HTTP warnings	YES</p>
<p>The code follows the Coding Standards	YES</p>
<p>Are there any leftover stubs or test routines in the code?	NO</p>
<p>Are there any hardcoded, development only things still in the code?	NO</p>
<p>Was performance considered?	YES</p>
<p>Was security considered?	NO</p>
<p>Does the code release resources? (HTTP connections, DB connection, files, etc)	YES</p>

 <p><b>REVIEWER CHECKLIST</b></p>

<p>Comments are comprehensible and add something to the maintainability of the code	NO. Comments are lacking.</p>
<p>Comments are neither too numerous nor verbose	YES</p>
<p>Types have been generalized where possible	YES</p>
<p>Parameterized types have been used appropriately	YES</p>
<p>Exceptions have been used appropriately	YES</p>
<p>Repetitive code has been factored out	YES</p>
<p>Frameworks have been used appropriately – methods have all been defined appropriately	YES</p>
<p>Command classes have been designed to undertake one task only	YES</p>	
<p>Common errors have been checked for	YES</p>
<p>Potential threading issues have been eliminated where possible	YES</p>
<p>Any security concerns have been addressed	NO</p>
<p>Performance was considered	YES</p>
<p>The functionality fits the current design/architecture	YES</p>
<p>The code is unit testable	YES</p>
<p>The code does not use unjustifiable static methods/blocks YES	</p>
<p>The code complies to coding standards	YES</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>My largest areas for improvement are functionality of the FinalProject_REST.py file, proper comments, and consideration of security. There are some inherent pymongo flaws that I may not be able to overcome. When printing the result of functions, pymongo returns the cursor location instead of the intended document/table. I have to try and figure out a work around to this.</p>
