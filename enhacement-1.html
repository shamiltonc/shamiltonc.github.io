    <h1>RESTful API: Enhancement 1</h1>
  </header>
   
<p>Samantha Hamilton
<p>SNHU CS499: Comp Sci Capstone
<p>Milestone 2: Enhancement 1

<p> This is the narrative of my first enhancement of my RESTful API, as required by my final Computer Science class at SNHU: Computer Science Capstone.</p>

<p><b>A.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </b></p>
<p>The artifact is a RESTful API service that I created a few months ago for the course CS-340 Client/Server Development. It was the course’s final project. It demonstrates administrative skills with a MongoDB database by implementing CRUD methods to retrieve and update data, and finally by turning each CRUD method into a RESTful service. </p>

<p><b>B.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? </b></p>
<p>I selected this item because it met all requirements of our final project, which makes it a solid demonstration of various aspects of software development and computer science for my ePortfolio. Because of the improvements I must make, this project also shows proficiency in code review and enhancement.</p>

<p><b>C.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </b></p>
<p>I am in the process of meeting the course objectives I planned to make. For this milestone, I added proper comments, ensured logical flow of code, and established security. My only update on my coverage plans thus far are to include a narrative about Security in the final product.</p>
<p>I began to consider security during my code review, where I realized that I had hardly thought about security while initially developing the program. As I made my enhancements for the software engineering requirement, I realized that security is somewhat built in. Because I used Codio, the program is already secured. Codio themselves state that code on their website is secure and safe. The MongoDB client was replicated from the school, thus it is secure as well.</p>

<p><b>D.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</b></p>
<p>As I was making my initial improvements -comments, ensuring coding best practices, and security- I learned the value of adding comments early on. If I had, I would not have had to re-evaluate my code so extensively to make these enhancements. I also have realized the importance of considering security in the initial concept phase of a program. Luckily, I had Codio and SNHU when developing this RESTful API. However, next time I may not. Thus, I need to consider security as early on as possible.</p>
<p><b>DEVELOPER CHECKLIST</b></p>
<p>My code compiles	YES</p>
<p>My code has been developer-tested and includes unit tests	YES	</p>
<p>My code is tidy (indentation, line length, no commented-out code, no spelling mistakes, etc)	YES</p>
<p>I have considered proper use of exceptions	YES</p>
<p>I have eliminated unused imports	YES</p>
<p>I have eliminated HTTP warnings	YES</p>
<p>The code follows the Coding Standards	YES</p>
<p>Are there any leftover stubs or test routines in the code?	NO</p>
<p>Are there any hardcoded, development only things still in the code?	NO</p>
<p>Was performance considered?	YES</p>
<p>Was security considered?	NO</p>
<p>Does the code release resources? (HTTP connections, DB connection, files, etc)	YES</p>

 <p><b>REVIEWER CHECKLIST</b></p>

<p>Comments are comprehensible and add something to the maintainability of the code	NO. Comments are lacking.</p>
<p>Comments are neither too numerous nor verbose	YES</p>
<p>Types have been generalized where possible	YES</p>
<p>Parameterized types have been used appropriately	YES</p>
<p>Exceptions have been used appropriately	YES</p>
<p>Repetitive code has been factored out	YES</p>
<p>Frameworks have been used appropriately – methods have all been defined appropriately	YES</p>
<p>Command classes have been designed to undertake one task only	YES</p>	
<p>Common errors have been checked for	YES</p>
<p>Potential threading issues have been eliminated where possible	YES</p>
<p>Any security concerns have been addressed	NO</p>
<p>Performance was considered	YES</p>
<p>The functionality fits the current design/architecture	YES</p>
<p>The code is unit testable	YES</p>
<p>The code does not use unjustifiable static methods/blocks YES	</p>
<p>The code complies to coding standards	YES</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>My largest areas for improvement are functionality of the FinalProject_REST.py file, proper comments, and consideration of security. There are some inherent pymongo flaws that I may not be able to overcome. When printing the result of functions, pymongo returns the cursor location instead of the intended document/table. I have to try and figure out a work around to this.</p>
