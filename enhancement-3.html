    <h1>RESTful API: Enhancement 1</h1>

<p>Milestone 4: Enhancement 3

<p> For this enhancement, I focused on my RESTful API’s interaction with the Mongo database.</p>

<p> I improved my queries to get better results. The new and improved queries use the proper HTTP 
CRUD methods when querying the RESTful API and retrieving information from the database. To do this, 
I had to recreate all my curl queries for the proper CRUD/HTTP method:</p>

<p><b>POST:</b> <i>curl -d '{"company":Corona,"industry":"Medical"}' -H 'Content-Type: 
application/json' http://localhost:8080/createStock/</i></p>

<p><b>GET:</b> <i>curl -v http://localhost:8080/getStock?company=”Corona”</i></p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> <i>Query: curl -d '{"company":"Corona", "Volume":"True"}' -H 
'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT http://localhost:8080/updateStock</i></p>

<p><b>DELETE:</b> <i>curl -v -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/deleteStock?company=”Corona”</i></p>

<p><b>A.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </b></p>
<p>The artifact is a RESTful API service that I created a few months ago for the course 
CS-340 Client/Server Development. It was the course’s final project. It demonstrates administrative 
skills with a MongoDB database by implementing CRUD methods to retrieve and update data, and finally by 
turning each CRUD method into a RESTful service. </p>

<p><b>B.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What 
specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was 
the artifact improved? </b></p>
<p>I selected this item because it met all requirements of our final project, which makes it a solid 
demonstration of various aspects of software development and computer science for my ePortfolio. Because 
of the improvements I must make, this project also shows proficiency in code review and enhancement.</p>

<p><b>C.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you 
have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </b></p>
<p>Yes, I met the planned objectives with this enhancement as I outlined them in Module One. For this Milestone, 
I worked on my API’s connection to the Mongo database and how I implemented pymongo to achieve functionality.</p>

<p><b>D.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were 
creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</b></p>
<p>I learned a lot more about how the CURL queries work with a RESTful API, and how those queries much be structured 
for the RESTful service to properly interact with the Mongo database. Creating the correct structure for the queries 
was my biggest challenge.</p>
