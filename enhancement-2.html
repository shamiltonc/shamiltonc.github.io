    <h1>RESTful API: Enhancement 2</h1>

<p>Milestone 3: Enhancement 2

<p> For this milestone, I decided to enhance my RESTful service, which involved improving the advanced queries to retrieve and 
modify data. After going back through my “FinalProject_REST” file, I realized that the RESTful functions only needed slight 
modification. For instance, at line 22 I changed the URI from “/createStock/AA“ to “/createStock“. At line 31, I changed the 
URI from “/getStock/AA“ to “/getStock“. At line 40, I changed “/updateStock/AA” to “/updateStock”. At line 54, I updated 
“/deteStock/AA” to “/deteStock”. Doing so prevented 405 errors that I was receiving when attempting to query the service.</p>

<p>After that, I went back through course material to find the proper way to query the RESTful service. Using a third terminal 
in Codio, I used curl statements to query the service. Here are my curl statements:</p>

<p><i>curl http"//localhost:8080/createStock?company="Corona"</i></p>
<p><i>curl http"//localhost:8080/getStock?company="BearFinance"</i></p>
<p><i>curl http"//localhost:8080/deleteStock?company="BearFinance"</i></p>

<p><b>A.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </b></p>
<p>The artifact is a RESTful API service that I created a few months ago for the course 
CS-340 Client/Server Development. It was the course’s final project. It demonstrates administrative 
skills with a MongoDB database by implementing CRUD methods to retrieve and update data, and finally 
by turning each CRUD method into a RESTful service. </p>

<p><b>B.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What 
specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was 
the artifact improved? </b></p>
<p>I selected this item because it met all requirements of our final project, which makes it a solid 
demonstration of various aspects of software development and computer science for my ePortfolio. Because 
of the improvements I must make, this project also shows proficiency in code review and enhancement.</p>

<p><b>C.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? 
Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </b></p>
<p>For this milestone, I focused on my RESTful service. I did meet the course objectives I planned to meet with this 
enhancement. I focused on functionality this time around, whereas last week I focused on code structure and coding best practices. </p>

<p><b>D.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and 
improving it? What challenges did you face?</b></p>
<p>I learned more about querying RESTful APIs than I knew before, and I realized once again that I was overthinking it. 
The biggest challenge I faced was getting rid of the HTTP 400 and 404 errors when querying the service.</p>
