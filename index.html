    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

  <p>My name is Samantha Hamilton. I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University and I work as an IT Support Engineer for a large online retailer. In my free time, I am a game designer.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase some of my works of the coding nature.</p>

  <p>I live in the St.Louis area with my fiance, my dog Jax, and my ferrets Gizmo and Gadget. I take a lot of inspiration from nature and my favorite video games. My favorite way to spend the day is with a cup of tea, a good book, and my laptop.</p>

  <p>Check out my projects!</p>
