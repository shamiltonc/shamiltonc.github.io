Welcome to my Portfolio!

My name is Samantha Hamilton. I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University and I work as an IT Support Engineer for a large online retailer. In my free time, I am a game designer. 

The purpose of this website is to showcase some of my works of the coding nature.

I live in the St.Louis area with my fiance, my dog Jax, and my ferrets Gizmo and Gadget. I take a lot of inspiration from my favorite video games. My favorite way to spend the day is with a cup of tea, a good book, and my laptop.
