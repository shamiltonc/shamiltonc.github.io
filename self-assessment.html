<p><b>SNHU and my career</b></p>
  
<p> My coursework at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) has molded the foundation of my strengths and goals in 
the Computer Science field. My journey at SNHU began with the fundamentals of various concepts in the Computer Science 
field, which I worked with every day in my role in the IT department of one of Amazon’s Fulfillment Centers in southern 
New Jersey. As I began to learn about Object-Oriented Analysis & Design, dipped my feet in MySQL for the first time, 
and learned about Software Development Lifecycle, I was able to apply all these concepts in my job. Amazon greatly 
encourages inventing and simplifying- so much so that “Invent and Simplify” is one of their famed Leadership Principles. 
I began writing scripts and dipping my toes into smaller projects at work to simplify and automate time-consuming IT 
processes, including creating scripts to ease the process of modifying and resolving help desk tickets. </p>

<p>As the concepts at school became more in-depth and began to build upon the fundamentals, my career at Amazon grew. As 
I began to learn in-depth Python, discrete mathematics, and database administration, I went from coordinating IT inventory 
to client device support and some network support. I used this knowledge to create more scripts and eventually policies 
that would become approved for use in Amazon network wide. In May of 2019, I relocated from New Jersey to Missouri to 
support the build of a new Amazon AR Fulfillment Center to apply all the knowledge I had gained in school. During this time, 
I also achieved my first certificate- -a CompTIA A+ certification in July of 2019.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, I began more advanced coursework such as client/server development, software test, automation, & QA, 
computer graphics and visualization, and more. My career grew in complexity and responsibility as my coursework did. I grew 
in my career at Amazon to wholly supporting the network for my new site and all other sites in the region, including the 
support of new builds of various types of Amazon sites. During this time, I began the development of an internal website for 
the purpose of replacing outdated training material for certain IT roles. I also began to explore Android app development, 
expanding from my coursework to creating my own applications.</p>

<p>No matter what direction my career takes, I have an indestructible desire to learn and apply my knowledge and to invent and 
share. The Computer Science program at SNHU has been vital in this.</p>

<p><b>This portfolio</b></p>

<p>My portfolio itself is hosted on GitHub and was created using GitHub Pages, meaning I began the website with a simple template 
and coded everything else myself, including any pages aside from the home page, as well as any interactive features, buttons, 
and links. I wrote this website using 100% HTML and CSS. You can view its repository on <a href="https://github.com/shamiltonc/shamiltonc.github.io"> 
GitHub</a> or download the code from either of the “Download” buttons in the header.</p>

<p>The first section of material on my portfolio is the review and enhancement of a RESTful API I developed as part of my 
coursework at SNHU (in the course Client/Server Development). It is the first section of my portfolio as a requirement of the 
completion of my degree. I chose this artifact to review and enhance as part of my coursework so I could demonstrate my ability 
to self-asses, gather feedback, and improve functioning code. This artifact also demonstrates my ability to create RESTful APIs, 
my knowledge of CRUD and its HTTP equivalents (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE), and, fundamentally, my knowledge of how server-side 
development interacts with the client-side interaction of a software. </p>

<p>Each enhancement of the RESTful API includes the version of code at that stage. The code included with the self-assessment 
is therefore considered “Version 0”, and the code after the third enhancement is considered “Version 3”. Please enjoy observing 
my process of enhancement as a result of feedback gathering.</p>

<p>I have also included an Android application called “Things To Do”. This application was not created as any sort of coursework, 
but rather out of my own interest. It demonstrates my ability to develop Android applications in Java, my comfort level with 
Android Studio and its features, and my ability to implement a database into a mobile application. </p>

<p>As I have already began developing more Android applications, please expect to see my portfolio and this self-assessment update!</p>
